/* Danny, inspired by the idea of "80s Retro Styling and Pizza Is The Future," 
launched Pizza Runner, an innovative pizza delivery service. Combining his passion 
for pizza with the convenience of on-demand delivery, Danny recruited runners and 
invested heavily in developing a mobile app for customer orders. With an entity 
relationship diagram of his database design in hand, he now seeks help to clean and 
analyze the data. This will enable him to better manage his delivery operations and 
optimize the efficiency of Pizza Runner. */
